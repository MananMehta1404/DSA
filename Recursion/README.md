# Recursion

- Recursion is a phenomena where a fucntion calls itself and this function is called recursive function.
- Recursion and Iteration are alternate approaches of each other. All problems that can be solved using iteration can also be solved using recursion and vice versa.
- Recursion is useful in solving various standard problems which might be very complicated to solve using iteration. Example -> Tree Traversals, Graph Traversals, Tower of Hanoi etc.
